# Info:<br/>
This was a term project. As such there was a lot of skeleton code done for us initially whereas we were responsible for adding signal captures, builtins, variable expansion, and piping capabilities.<br/>
For the most part, I succeeded at writing this program. The builtins all seem to work, signals are captured, variables work. The only real issues were with exit statuses and running asynchronous commands<br/>
Overall, the goal of this project was to learn more about the backend of operating systems and to write something functional enough to interact with these backends and it succeeded with that
